# Autoarxiv
It's a python program help to make a latex folder for arxiv. You can make a new blank folder with template and folders of sections, equations, tables, algorithms, and figures. Also you can generate a folder for arxiv according to your own latex folder. Also it can generate a .bbl file without latex compiler due to demand of arxiv for reference (only .bbl but not .bib)
